        <h1>Gameplay basics</h1>
        <p>
            The goal of the game is to create crystals and use them to generate resources in order to progress.
            To work, crystals need to be connected to the core (the rainbow crystal in the center).
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Move crystals using drag&drop</li>
            <li>Right- or double-click crystals to drop them into your inventory</li>
            <li>Toggle links by clicking on them</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Connected links are animated to represent flow. Power (and ticks) flow downstream from the core path.
            When there is a tie for distance, the link is inactive.
        <p>
            Different stats and crystals do different things to upstream or downstream parts, so your layout is key.
        </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            To start off, drag a Simple Glow <span class="small-glyph glyph-glow"></span> crystal from the Conjure panel on the right into a hexagonal slot on the board.
            Then click links between the core and that crystal until you see green links flowing to the crystal from the core.
        </p>
        <p>
            The crystal will start generating resources every tick. Conjure more crystals and expand your setup.
            Place some Arcana <span class="small-glyph glyph-arcana"></span> crystals to convert mana into a new resource that you can use to purchase upgrades in the Enchant tab.

        <h1>Refinement</h1>
        <p>
            Refinement shows the capacity of a crystal. Aspect effects scale with amount, so in the beginning
            you might want to reroll crystals until you get decently-filled ones. Flaw is a waste Aspect that you'll learn to deal with later on.
            Note the difference in mana generation:

        <h1>Experience</h1>
        <p>
            Spending Arcana on enchantments gives you a proportionate amount of experience. Gaining enough will
            let you reset your run - Ascend - and gain talent points, allowing you to unlock new Aspects and crystals.
